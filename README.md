This repo contains the work that I would like to share to the public.

This repo adopt multi-module structure and each module is tag separately,
so users can import the required component on their need.

Some module/package provided till know:

- "async": a type safe version of sync group parallel execution.
- "flow": helper functions around the "iter.Seq" types.
