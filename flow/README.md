## `flow`: Helper Library for FP-Style Processing

Since Go 1.23, we have `iter.Seq` as the standard representation for
a iterator / generator.

Although there also be a `x/exp/xiter` library for common operation,
but it's seems lacking some critical building wheels. So here is this library.

See [PkgSite](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/wdhongtw/mice/flow)
for more information.
